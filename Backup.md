# Backup Strategy for Huginn Automation

## Overview

This document outlines the backup strategy for the Huginn automation instance, including database backups and configuration files.

## Backup Frequency

- **Database Backups**: Daily at 2 AM.
- **Configuration Backups**: Weekly on Sundays at 3 AM.

## Backup Locations

- **Database**: Store backups in `/path/to/backup/location/db_backups/`.
- **Configuration**: Store backups in `/path/to/backup/location/config_backups/`.

## Backup Process

### 1. Database Backup

Create a script named `backup_db.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
mysqldump -u huginn -p'huginn_password' huginn > /path/to/backup/location/db_backups/huginn_backup_$DATE.sql
```

### 2. Configuration Backup

Create a script named `backup_config.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
tar -czvf /path/to/backup/location/config_backups/huginn_config_$DATE.tar.gz /path/to/huginn/config/
```

### 3. Cron Jobs

Add the following lines to your crontab:

```bash
# Daily Database Backup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /path/to/backup_db.sh

# Weekly Configuration Backup at 3 AM on Sundays
0 3 * * 0 /path/to/backup_config.sh

```

## Verification

Regularly check backup files for integrity and ensure that they are being created as scheduled.

## Restoration Process

To restore from a backup, use the following commands:

## Database Restoration
```
mysql -u huginn -p'huginn_password' huginn < /path/to/backup/location/db_backups/huginn_backup_DATE.sql
```

## Configuration Restoration
```
tar -xzvf /path/to/backup/location/config_backups/huginn_config_DATE.tar.gz -C /path/to/huginn/config/
```

## Conclusion

Implementing this backup strategy will ensure that your Huginn instance remains safe and recoverable in case of data loss or corruption.
